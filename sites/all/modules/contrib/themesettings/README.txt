THEME SETTINGS
--------------

You can now easily edit the style and positioning of the 'Read more' and
'Comments' links.  Just go to /admin/build/themes/settings and take a look!


"READ MORE" LINK
----------------

- Use HTML in the link text, so you could even replace the normal link text with
  an image! (With proper alt text, of course.)
- Change the tool tip (the text that appears when you hover over the link.)
- Add prefix or suffix text (or HTML) that will be placed just outside the
  actual link.
- Change the positioning of the link. Use Drupal's default or append the link as
  a new paragraph to the content or append the link as a sentence on the last
  paragraph of the content.
- Use different "Read more" link text for each content type on your website.


"COMMENTS" LINKS
----------------

- Use HTML in the link text, so you could even replace the normal link text with
  an image! (With proper alt text, of course.)
- Change the tool tip (the text that appears when you hover over the link.)
- Add prefix or suffix text (or HTML) that will be placed just outside the
  actual link.
- Change the positioning of the link. Use Drupal's default or append/prepend the
  link to the "Read more" link.
- Use different "Comments" link text for each content type on your website.


ABOUT THE PROJECT
-----------------

It is currently too difficult for non-coders to change simple things like the
positioning and text of the "Read more" link or the Comments link. Even copy and
pasting PHP from recipes is a bit much for most people. See:

The Theme Settings project looks to make this functionality easily accessible
to Drupal administrators.
